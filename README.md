# ðŸ§© Dynamic Profile API â€” HNG Backend Wizards Stage 0  

A simple **Django REST Framework** API that returns my profile details and a **random cat fact** fetched dynamically from the public [Cat Facts API](https://catfact.ninja/fact).  

This project was built as part of **HNG 11 â€” Backend Wizards (Stage 0)** to demonstrate my understanding of RESTful endpoints, third-party API integration, and structured JSON responses.
